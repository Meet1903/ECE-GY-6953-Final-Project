File: LayoutGAN_Mnist.ipynb
Download it to your local PC or upload it to the Google Colab. You can use any tool which supports notebook (.ipynb) files.
Download the MNIST.npy file from the Github repository.
Perform below steps to modify the code according your environment:
    1. Update smaple_dir variable with the path to the folder where you want to store the result images.
    2. Update dataset_path variable with the path where you stored MNIST.npy file.
    3. Run the code from the first beginning. 

File: LayoutGAN_PubLayNet.ipynb
Download it to your local PC or upload it to the Google Colab. You can use any tool which supports notebook (.ipynb) files.
Download the sorted_c1publay.npy file from the Github repository.
Perform below steps to modify the code according your environment:
    1. Update smaple_dir variable with the path to the folder where you want to store the result images.
    2. Update dataset_path variable with the path where you stored sorted_c1publay.npy file.
    3. Run the code from the first beginning. 

GPU is preferred, but not necessary. Machine with GPU can perform the training faster compared to non-GPU machines.
