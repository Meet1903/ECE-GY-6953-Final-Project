## Steps to run the code:

\
**File: LayoutGAN_Mnist.ipynb**

Download it to your local PC or upload it to the Google Colab. You can use any tool which supports notebook (.ipynb) files.

Download the **MNIST.npy** file from the Github repository.

Perform below steps to modify the code according your environment:

1. Update the smaple_dir variable with the path to the folder where you want to store the result images.

2. Update the dataset_path variable with the path where you stored MNIST.npy file.

3. Run the code from the first beginning.

\
**File: LayoutGAN_PubLayNet.ipynb**

Download it to your local PC or upload it to the Google Colab. You can use any tool which supports notebook (.ipynb) files.

Download the **sorted_c1publay.npy** file from the Github repository.

Perform below steps to modify the code according your environment:

1. Update the smaple_dir variable with the path to the folder where you want to store the result images.

2. Update the dataset_path variable with the path where you stored sorted_c1publay.npy file.

3. Run the code from the first beginning.

  

GPU is preferred, but not necessary. Machine with GPU can perform the training faster compared to non-GPU machines.
